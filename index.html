    <h1> Fall Is Falling Near </h1>

    <p> This is the first sentence, the least import one of them all. For today marks the beginning of the story that ends with yesterday. If you're lost in pondering why, it's rather simple. It's because this is your story, the one you create with each passing day. And this is the ending you've not been waiting for, that lets you know that the ending has come to start the story anew. </p>
